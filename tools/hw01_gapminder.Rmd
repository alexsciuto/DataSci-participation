## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r gapminder}

# this installs necessary packages and loads them
install.packages("gapminder")
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("dplyr")
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)
library(dplyr)


# this displays the rows and columns present in the dataset
unique(gapminder)

# this displays the mean life expectancy in the data
mean(gapminder$lifeExp)

hist(gapminder$gdpPercap, breaks=100, main = "Histogram displaying GDP per Capita")

hist(gapminder$lifeExp, freq=FALSE, xlab = "Life expectancy", ylab = "density", main = "Distribution of Life Expectancy", breaks = 50, col="lightgreen") 


plot(gapminder$year, gapminder$lifeExp)

life_expectancy = dplyr::mutate(gapminder, 
                  lifeExpMedian = median(lifeExp),
                  lifeExpStatus = ifelse(lifeExpMedian > lifeExp, "high life expectancy", "low life expectancy"))

(vf.sc.accuracy <- ggplot(life_expectancy,
                           aes(x = lifeExpStatus), 
                               y = lifeExp)) +
    theme_classic()+
   labs(x = "High or low life expectancy", y = "life expectancy")



```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
